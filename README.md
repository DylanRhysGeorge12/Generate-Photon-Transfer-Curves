# Generate-Photon-Transfer-Curves
Generate your own Photon Transfer Curves for your cameras.
Classic Photon transfer curves using counts and electrons can be made. All you need is one image in the dark for your camera (Dark Image).
Additionally, more images at varying light intensity. Try keeping the illumination as uniform as possible for best results. Enjoy!
